# AI Coursework

A collection of courses, projects, and learning materials for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## Courses

### Domestika - Introduction to AI with Python
Projects exploring:
- Supervised Learning (linear/logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks)
- Unsupervised Learning (SVM, K-means clustering)
- Reinforcement Learning

## Learning Documentation
Each project includes:
- **Key Learning Point Analysis**: Highlights important concepts and insights gained
- **Model/Process Implementation Summary**: Documents the steps and processes used

Each course directory also contains a `summary_key_learning.ipynb` file that compiles all knowledge and insights gained throughout the course.

## Structure
- Each course has its own directory with projects and materials
- Assets directory contains datasets and files used across projects

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for dependencies
